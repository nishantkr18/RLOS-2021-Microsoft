# How to run:
*This page helps in creating and running the tests for this project.*

## Code:

Work on Parallel parsing was performed last year by Cassandra. My work this year builds upon the previous work. So, the updated branch (containing all the work done last year, and updated with the master branch(just compiles)) is the [`multithread_parser_with_passes`](https://github.com/nishantkr18/vowpal_wabbit/tree/multithread_parser_with_passes). Hence, I've created pull requests against that branch for easy comparisions.

Currently, there are three active branches in [`nishantkr18/vowpal_wabbit`](https://github.com/nishantkr18/vowpal_wabbit):
- `multithread_parser_with_passes`: contains work from last year. All new changes compared against this.
- `simplified_interaction`: contains all the work done this year for multithreading.
*(The name "simplified interaction" comes from the most efficient plan we could think of for supporting multiple passes, after several complex ideas)*
- `master-benchmark` : contains an extra timer script for creating benchmarks for the master branch.

Inactive branches (not updated):
- `cache_reader_working`: modifies the cache reader functions to read from a character` pointer directly, therefore doesnâ€™t require any dummy io_buf instance.

The rest of the branches contain implementation of ideas that were eventually dropped.

### Building:
Initially I used Debian(Ubuntu 20.04) for the project, which is easy to work on, given that all the dependencies and build instructions are provided on the vowpal wabbit github wiki.

Later, I shifted to Arch, for which I just had to install the additional `cmake` and `boost` libraries (can be installed using a simple `pacman -S`).

**Tip:** To avoid getting the annoying warning everytime you build VW, use: `cmake ../ -DWARNINGS=OFF`. 
### Benchmark dataset:
All benchmarks are carried out on a repeated sample of the dataset 0001.dat available in the repository tests [here](https://github.com/nishantkr18/vowpal_wabbit/blob/simplified_interaction/test/train-sets/0001.dat).
We have used two variants of the dataset:
- **hundred thousand examples**: to generate, run `for i in {1..500}; do cat ../test/train-sets/0001.dat >> ../../0001_ht.dat; done ` from the build directory.
- **million examples**: to generate, run `for i in {1..5000}; do cat ../test/train-sets/0001.dat >> ../../0001_million.dat; done ` from the build directory.

### Commands used for testing:
A typical command used for testing and benchmarks is:
`time vowpalwabbit/vw ~/i2.dat --num_parse_threads=100 --passes=100 -c -k`

Here I list the purpose of some important flags which you should use for your own tests:
- `-c`: Use cache.
- `-k`: Overwrite cache file.
- `--json`: If you are using JSON input format.
- `--passes`: To indicate number of passes.
- `--holdout_off`: Dont early stop (in the case of multiple passes).
- `--num_parse_threads`: number of parser threads to use. 
- `--no_learner`: Essentially mocks the learner. Skips the all.learn call.
- `--quiet`: No output is printed. Advised to use with `time` to avoid distracting outputs when benchmarking.

Additionally, the `timer_0001.sh` file contains snippets to create benchmarks on the 0001 dataset variants for text, JSON and cache formats, including multiple passes.

### Using callgrind:
The popular profiler Valgrind has this amazing tool called calgrind which helps visualize the total CPU time taken to run parts of the code. Try it out using:
```bash
valgrind --tool=callgrind vowpalwabbit/vw <data file>
kcachegrind <callgrind output file>
```
Note: For better source code tracking, use a debug build.
