## Abstract:
Example parsing is an expensive part of VW training pipeline. Support for parallel parsing of text input was contributed last year, but it doesnâ€™t support the more efficient cache format.

- **Goals**: Design and implement an extension to the cache file format to support efficient parallel parsing.

- **Outcomes**: Ability to utilize multicore machines more effectively when training with cache format.
